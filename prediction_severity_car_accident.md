# Predicting the Severity of Car Accident

## 1. Introduction
Seattle city as an example of how to deal with
the accidents data.
### 1.1 Background
you are driving to another city for work or
to visit some friends. It is rainy and windy,
and on the way, you come across a
terrible traffic jam on the other side of the highway. Long lines of cars barely moving. As you keep driving, police car start appearing from afar shutting down the highway. Oh, it is an accident
and there's a helicopter transporting the ones involved in the crash to the
nearest hospital. They must be in
critical condition for all of this to be happening. Now, wouldn't it be
great if there is something in place
that could warn you, given the weather and
the road conditions about the possibility of you getting into a car accident
and how severe it would be, so that you would
drive more carefully or even change your travel
if you are able to. Well, this is exactly
what you will be working on in this course.
