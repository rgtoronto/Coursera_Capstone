### Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

Imagine if we can predict the severity of an incident in a certain circumstance. we can somehow avoid the injure tragic happening by avoiding one or more of the factors.

We will use supervised learning to handle the prediction.

This will be a classification problem that falls under the supervised learning method. From the given dataset, with predefined labels, we need to build a model to predict the class of a new or unknown case.

### Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using.
This project will focus on using the surrounding circumstances data to predict the severity of the accident.

for example: 'ADDRTYPE','ROADCOND','LIGHTCOND','INCDATE','INCDTTM' to predict the severity patterns.

The target field, called 'SEVERITYCODE', has 2 possible values that correspond to the 2 severity level, as follows:

1- Property Damage Only Collision

2- Injury Collision

The objective of this project is to build a classifier and to predict the class of the unknown cases. We will use run through all types of classification to evaluate them based on the accuracy of the built model.
